I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Casey Papovich, for the continual support of my research pursuits, his unwavering patience, the stern and kind words, his encouragement, and vast knowledge. His support and guidance have helped me throughout all stages of researching and writing this thesis. I can confidently say that I would not have arrived alone, and I cannot imagine a better advisor for my study.

To my thesis committee: Dr. Wolfgang Bangerth, Dr. Louis Strigari, and Dr. Nicholas Suntzeff who were always at the ready with invaluable comments and encouragement, and for never shying away from asking the hard questions which pushed me to new heights. Thank you.

I thank my fellow graduate students with whom I spent so much of my life. Thank you for all the stimulating discussions, homework and research help, encouragement, and the fun over the previous six years. I wish you all nothing but the best.

Finally, I could not have accomplished this with out the love and support of my family and friends. I am so very fortunate that there are too many to name, but thank you for always believing in me, and never letting my sometimes pessimistic feelings tarnish your optimism. I can never repay you. 

Thank you.
